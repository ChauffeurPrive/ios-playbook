# Create a branch

Now that you’re all set, you need to work on some task, be it a new feature or a technical task.

## Prerequisite

* The link to a Jira ticket with all the specifications of the task.

## Steps

Branches need to be named in a specific format. It should follow these rules :

1. Always start with the name of the app it’s for. It’s either `rider` or `driver`.
2. If you’re working on a feature, you will follow it with `feature`. If you're working on a bug fix, you will follow it with `bugfix`.
3. Then you can follow, with the Jira ticket number. Or if you’re working on a technical task, choose a name that best describes what you will be working on.

Examples of branches :

* rider/bugfix/OR-878
* rider/feature/OR-567
* driver/feature/cancelConfirm
