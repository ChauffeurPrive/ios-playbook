# Join the right Slack channels

As an iOS engineer, you should join these channels :

* `#tech`
* `#guild-ios`
* `#guild-mobile`
* `#mobile`
* `#tech-pr-mobile`
* `#tech-ios-events`

Make sure you also join your tribe/squad's Slack channels. Some may be private so you will need to ask someone to invite you.
